<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com">Reddit</a> is a discussion forum website with many discussion rooms (“subreddits”) on different topics. Greenville, SC has its <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/greenville/">own subreddit</a>. It might be of interest to see what kind of discussions take place. We can do this in a systematic way using the <a href="http://www.r-project.org">R software</a> through a technique called text mining. We will do a simple text mining exercise here.</p>
