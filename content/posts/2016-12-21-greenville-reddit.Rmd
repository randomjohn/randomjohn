[Reddit](http://www.reddit.com) is a discussion forum website with many discussion rooms ("subreddits") on different topics. Greenville, SC has its [own subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/greenville/). It might be of interest to see what kind of discussions take place. We can do this in a systematic way using the [R software](http://www.r-project.org) through a technique called text mining. We will do a simple text mining exercise here.
