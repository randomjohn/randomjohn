# About me

I'm a statistician living in the Upstate SC area (Greenville/Spartanburg) with an interest in Bayesian methodology, machine learning, and open data. For over 15 years, I have designed and analyzed clinical trials, with an emphasis in oncology and neurology. I consult on data science projects using civic and open data. Finally, I participate in the Upstate Data Science and Analytics meetup.

# Description

This blog is designed to supplement my blog over at [Realizations in Biostatistics](http://realizationsinbiostatistics.blogspot.com). This part is geared more toward data analysis, basically because I can write my blog posts in R Markdown and push them to the web. Blogger doesn't make that very easy.

The [Upstate Data Science and Analytics group](https://www.meetup.com/Greenville-Data-Science-Analytics-Meetup/) meets (mostly) monthly.
